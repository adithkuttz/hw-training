69819c4fc0a43de9049e43c2,0200751,,3M[TM] Roloc[TM] Disc 361F features an aluminum oxide abrasive which is a popular choice among industrial professionals because of its fast cut-rate and long life. This mineral makes a tough durable abrasive that self-fractures to expose fresh cutting edges whereas traditional natural abrasives dull more quickly. Due to its fast cut-rate hardness and strength it is widely used in grinding applications in addition to sanding and finishing applications. Aluminum oxide is suitable for a wide variety of materials in both woodworking and metalworking including ferrous alloys.Heat-resistant resin is a sturdy binding agent that adheres the abrasive to the backing and maintains the stability of the bond even in conditions of high heat or pressure. Cloth-backed discs are known for their durability and flexibility. They're a good first choice when working with metal or for heavy wood stock removal.3M[TM] Roloc[TM] Disc 361F is available for use with the following Roloc attachment systems: TSM TR TP and TS.

With 3M Precision-Shaped Grain 3M engineers developed a process for generating triangular shaped ceramic grains that are electrostatically oriented on the backing to form sharp peaks and maximize cutting potential. These peaks act like individual cutting tools that slice through metal and continuously fracture into new sharp cutting edges. The grains wear evenly and self-sharpen reducing heat due to friction to deliver up to twice the life of other fibre discs with less grinding pressure. The result is that 3M Cubitron[TM] II Fibre Disc 982C out-cuts and outlasts every conventional ceramic industrial abrasive disc on the market maximizing productivity and helping reduce your overall abrasive spend.Ideal for Robotic Weld GrindingIn medium and high-pressure applications like robotic weld grinding it's important to choose a high-performance abrasive that cuts fast and lasts long.

Choose the Cubitron[TM] II Roloc Fibre Disc 982C for medium to heavy-duty stock removal on carbon steel applications such as edge chamfering beveling weld grinding and removing mill scale pits and imperfections machining grooves and more.3M[TM] Cubitron[TM] II products have raised the bar for high-performing abrasives. 3M precision-shaped grain outcuts and outlasts conventional ceramic industrial abrasives and requires less grinding force to achieve superior performance. The result is that operators can grind faster and complete more parts per disc with less muscle-work and fatigue.To create PSG engineers started with 3M[TM] Ceramic Abrasive Grain and used proprietary technology to form the grains into triangular structures and electrostatically orient them on the backing to form sharp peaks that maximize cutting potential. These peaks slice cleanly through metal rather than gouging or plowing as traditional abrasive grains do and continuously self-sharpen as the points break off. This generates a super-fast cut and lessens heat build-up due to friction reducing heat-related stress cracks and discoloration.PSG also wears evenly and because the abrasive itself stays cooler and sharper Cubitron II products last significantly longer than their conventional ceramic counterparts ensuring extended high performance in production applications.Fiber discs are heavy-duty discs ideal for weld removal grinding and blending large and small areas of metal surfaces. They feature a tough stiff backing made from vulcanized fiber that resist wear and can handle tough grinding applications.

For long life and durability the disc is constructed with a laminated 2-ply polyester backing for wear-resistance in edge work.Because PSG contributes to an exceptionally high cut-rate with less pressure operators can finish tough tasks faster and with less fatigue. A grinding aid incorporated on the disc makes this an outstanding product for all types of metal—it helps keep the disc cooler on stainless steel and heat-sensitive metals such as nickel alloys and titanium thereby reducing metal discoloration/oxidation and the chance of heat-related stress cracks.3M[TM] Cubitron[TM] II products have raised the bar for high-performing abrasives. 3M Precision-Shaped Grain outcuts and outlasts conventional ceramic industrial abrasives and requires less grinding force to achieve superior performance. The result is that operators can grind faster and complete more parts per disc with less muscle-work and fatigue.To create PSG engineers started with 3M[TM] Ceramic Abrasive Grain and used proprietary technology to form the grains into triangular structures and electrostatically orient them on the backing to form sharp peaks that maximize cutting potential. These peaks slice cleanly through metal rather than gouging or plowing as traditional abrasives do and continuously self-sharpen as the points break off. This generates a super-fast cut and lessens heat build-up due to friction reducing heat-related stress cracks and discoloration.PSG also wears evenly and because the abrasive itself stays cooler and sharper Cubitron[TM] II products last significantly longer than their conventional ceramic counterparts ensuring extended high performance in production applications.3M[TM] Cubitron[TM] II Roloc[TM] Durable Edge Disc 984F is available for use with the following Roloc attachment systems: TR TSM and TS.
