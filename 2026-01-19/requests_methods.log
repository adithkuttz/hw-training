Training Log – Python Requests Methods

 Request handling
Requests library is used to send HTTP requests like GET and POST.

 Response handling
Response object contains status_code, headers, text, and json data.

 POST request & payloads
POST requests send data using payloads (data or json parameters).

 Cookies and session
Session object maintains cookies across multiple requests.

 Certificate verification
Requests verifies SSL certificates by default for secure connections.

 API identification and data extraction
APIs commonly use GET calls to return JSON data.
Data is extracted using response.json().

 Proxies
Proxies are used to route requests.
Both HTTP and HTTPS proxies must be defined in proxies dictionary.

 Exceptions
Requests provides exception handling for timeout, connection, and HTTP errors.

 Better coding with requests
Use sessions, proper headers, timeouts, and error handling.

 nohup
nohup allows running scripts in background without terminal interruption.

Conclusion:
Python requests library provides simple and powerful HTTP handling features.
