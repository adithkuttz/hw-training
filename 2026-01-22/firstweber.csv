I earned my Bachelor's degree from Illinois State University, where I also met my wife. Together, we’ve built a life around family, community, and a deep appreciation for the opportunities that brought us to Madison. My love for Wisconsin started early, thanks to a high school teacher who organized annual ski trips to Cascade Mountain. From those early visits, I knew Wisconsin would one day be home. When the chance to relocate came, Madison stood out as the perfect fit—with its balance of vibrant city life and surrounding small-town charm. Since making the move, we've helped bring three households of family here, and it’s been one of the best decisions we’ve made. Outside of real estate, I’m passionate about music and food. I’ve written and recorded two albums and continue to play guitar and write songs. I’ve also developed a love for BBQ—there’s nothing better than slow-smoked meals shared with family and friends. My two daughters are the heart of everything I do and my biggest ""why"" in life.
